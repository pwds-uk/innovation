          Level 7 University Credits 20 ECTS Credits 10 Summary The aim of this
          theory-led, practically orientated course is to enhance students'
          conceptual and practical understanding of: - The role of the
          entrepreneur in start-up processes. - Practical ways of recognising,
          assessing and articulating start-up opportunities. - Methods for
          designing business models, products and validating market potential. -
          Options for scaling up a start-up. Course description The course
          provides a theory- and practice-based understanding of entrepreneurial
          start-up motivations and processes. This has the practical benefit of
          allowing students to assess the desirability and feasibility of
          starting up a business as a career option. The aim, therefore, is that
          students emerge from the course with a solid academic and practical
          understanding of how start-up entrepreneurs go about creating,
          delivering and capturing value for their customers. They will also
          learn experientially through processes of brainstorming, prototyping,
          and customer engagement. Topics include, but are not limited to: •
          Entrepreneurship and Entrepreneurs. • Entrepreneurial Planning. •
          Strategic Entrepreneurship. • Prototyping. • Innovation and Growth. •
          Entrepreneurial Leadership • Social Entrepreneurship Student
          experience: The class is oriented around a group venture creation
          project in which students develop a proposal for a viable, scalable
          new venture. The conceptual topics discussed in the class will be
          applied through the process of working on this assessment. The core
          idea for this will be shared with the work students do in
          Entrepreneurial Finance. Course Delivery Information Delivery

          Module Title: Managing Innovation in Context Course Outline Level 7
        University Credits 20 ECTS Credits 10 Summary Creating new businesses,
        attracting new customers, developing new products and services, and
        discovering new value propositions happen, often and increasingly so,
        through innovation. Shifts in market, the emergence of new technologies,
        changes in the political and regulatory landscape, competition and
        globalisation compel both entrepreneurs and existing firms to foster
        innovation. This course examines the activities, practices and
        competencies involved in managing innovation in firms, whether they are
        start-ups or established firms, and large or small. The course explores
        the approach to organise and manage innovation across the range of
        different types of innovation, whether product, services, technologies,
        or business models. Course description Aims, Nature, Context: The
        ability of organisations to manage innovation is critical to their
        survival whether these organisations are small start-ups or large,
        established multinationals. While competitive advantage can come from
        size, location, or the possession of rare and inimitable resources, the
        pattern is increasingly favouring those organisations which can mobilize
        market and technological skills and experience to create novelty in
        their products and services, and in the ways in which they create and
        deliver these products and services. The aim of this course is to
        clarify what innovation is, and how it can be organised and managed in
        firms to create value. This course will provide students with a
        foundational knowledge of the key concepts and frameworks of innovation
        and an awareness of their practical application within organisations
        which is necessary for later practical and theoretical courses in the
        MSc in Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme. Outline: 1.
